This directory contains splunk licenses.  They are currently deployed as follows:
	SIZE	SYSTEM
	3G.a	redsky
	3G.b	glory
	2G.a	(unused)
	2G.b	(unused)

Deployment process is to copy a license to an hpc/systems/SYSTEM/splunk.license and
make a symlink to it, eg on redsky:
	cd /logs/splunk/etc
	ln -s apps/hpc/systems/redsky/splunk.license
