\section{The ``Summary" Dashboard}
This dashboard is the front page of the HPC app.  

\subsection{Logs in a job}
To see all the events in a certain {\tt jobid}, enter it into the second pane
and hit return.  It uses the {\tt job} macro underneath (eg {\tt
`job(jobid)`}), which searches for the most recent event with {\tt jobid}
in {\tt sourcetype=moabstats}, identifies the start and end times, and the 
set of hosts the job ran on, and expands it via a subsearch.  See 
\cite{stearley-slaml10} for more details.

\subsection{Hosts Of Interest}
This pane shows hosts in an UnscheduledDowntime state.  Clicking on a row
brings up the logs for that host, from five minutes before it went down to 
one minute after.  It is using the {\tt hostdownwin(host,before,after)} macro
underneath.

\subsection{Messages of Interest}
This pane shows hosts and how many of which types of events have occurred lately.
Events reported are those having {\tt tag=moi} (messages of interest).  Click
on a row to see those events for that host.
