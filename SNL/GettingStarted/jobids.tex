\section{Using Jobid's}
Typical use is to see bad events on the Summary dashboard, click on a row to see them,
and use workflow actions to then look at the other events in the job.
\subsection{Workflow Action}
The previously described {\tt jobid} field also has a workflow action.
For a message having a non-empty {\tt jobid} value, pull-down the jobid menu, 
and select the job macro.
\subsection{MOI by job,host}
This dashboard is a useful summary of what MOI are happening on what hosts,
for what users.  It is under the MOI menu in the black bar at top.
