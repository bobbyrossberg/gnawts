\section{Introduction}
The ``HPC" Splunk App facilitates the analysis of logs from high performance
computing (HPC) systems.  Developed by Sandia National Laboratories, it employs
a wide variety of Splunk features, providing helpful tools to both system
administrators and researchers.  This document provides rough notes on how to
{\em get started} with set-up and use; this is {\em not} a polished or
exhaustive manual.

NOTE: {\bf This app requires the Sideview-Utils app (only tested with 1.3.4).}
