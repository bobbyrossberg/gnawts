The ``HPC" Splunk App facilitates the analysis of logs from high performance
computing (HPC) systems.  Developed by Sandia National Laboratories, it employs
a wide variety of Splunk features, providing helpful tools to both system
administrators and researchers.  This document provides information on how to
{\em get started} with setting it up and using it (this is {\em not} an
exhaustive manual).
