Copy this whole directory structure to splunk/etc/apps/hpc/, eg
  cd splunk/etc/apps/hpc
  svn checkout svn+ssh://software.sandia.gov/svn/private/splunk-hpc/trunk/hpc hpc

Then tailor via a local symlink to a system directory, eg
  ln -s systems/redsky local

The system directories contain both local conf and lookup files, so lookups is
a symlink to local (splunk expects both local and lookups dirs).
