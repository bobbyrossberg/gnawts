This directory has utilities for groking ib routes.

SAMPLE USAGE:
 Use copy_routes.sh to snapshot routes on admin2-man.
 Output routes for two of the above dumps:
  time ./dumps2routes ~/data/1324317770.dump.gz
  time ./dumps2routes ~/data/1324317742.dump.gz
 Determine the difference between them:
  time ./diffroute.sh 1324317742.routes 1324317770.routes
 Import 1324317742-1324317770.diff into splunk.


TODO:
1. import into splunk
2. form the queries in splunk
3. decide which diffs to import into splunk (all, only some?)
