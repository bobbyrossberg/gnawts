# MOAB stats RSV events do not use LLNL genders compressed host format
# as of 3/21/2012.  As a result, such lines can get extremely long and
# become truncated in transmission or import to Splunk, resulting in
# incorrect or incomplete component operations status (COS)
# information in Splunk-HPC's summary index.  To correct for this (or
# other manual corrections), have Splunk-HPC monitor a manually
# curated file.  Be careful, but this script can help...
# 
# This script can convert long RSV host lists into compressed LLNL
# genders format.  It can be run like `grep RSV moab/stats/events.* |
# CompressRSV.pl >> CompressedRSV.moabstats`.  If the raw moabstats
# logs are truncated, try forming your hostlist like this in
# Splunk-HPC:
#   index=summary orig_index=hpc_redsky | dedup orig_host | fields + orig_host | mvcombine orig_host | eval long=mvjoin(orig_host,",") | lookup hostlist long OUTPUT short | fields + short
# where redsky is the system name in this example (change that to your
# system name).  Once you have your hostlist, manually edit your
# event, and then append it to CompressedRSV.log.  Have Splunk-HPC
# monitor CompressedRSV.moabstats (add new lines to it as needed), the
# monitor stanza should declare it as sourcetype=moabstats.
#
# On redsky, truncation occurs at transmission via syslog-ng,
# so you have to get the raw events from admin3-man...
