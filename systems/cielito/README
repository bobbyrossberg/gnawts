SETUP
1. put the data in /cielito, eg in the splunk-hpc/logs/cielito directory do
   sudo ln -s `pwd` /cielito
   


RAS Metrics Stuff:
1. seed the summary index by doing this search OVER ALL TIME:
     tag=state | statechange "{'USR-ERR_Threshold':7, 'nodeField':'nid'}" | collect index=summary
   this is a good test search to see what statechange is doing:
     tag=state | statechange "{'USR-ERR_Threshold':7, 'nodeField':'nid'}" | table _time nid nodeStateChange ERR SYS USR systemStateChange crossing 
2. backfill with systemUptimeHoursToday by running this command:
 python bin/backfill_systemUptimeHoursToday.py
3. now see the RAS Metrics view.  Need to review for correctness of metrics, particularly JMTTI.

If we were doing number-of-uptime based stats, things would be much easier, eg:
SMTTI of last 5 uptimes
| delta _time AS durationSeconds | eval durationHours=round(durationSeconds/3600,2) | streamstats avg(durationHours) AS SMTTI window=5 global=f | timechart max(MTTI) AS SMTTI
