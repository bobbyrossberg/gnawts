SETUP
1. put the data in /cielito, eg in the splunk-hpc/logs/cielito directory do
   sudo ln -s `pwd` /cielito
   


RAS Metrics Stuff:
1. seed the summary index with statechanges by doing this search OVER ALL TIME:
   tag=state | lookup nodes node OUTPUT nid | tail 50000 | statechange | collect
2. if the number of events processed above is greter than 50k, run (over all time):
    [search index=summary StateName | head 1 | eval query="(_time="._time." index=summary StateName) OR (_time>"._time." tag=state)" | fields + query] | tail 50000 | lookup nodes node OUTPUT nid | statechange

    [search index=summary nodeStateList | head 1 | eval query="(_time="._time." index=summary nodeStateList) OR (_time>"._time." tag=state)" | fields + query] | reverse | statechange "{'USR-ERR_Threshold':7, 'USR-SYS_Threshold':7}" 
   and run it repeatedly until the number of events is less than 50k.
2. backfill the summary index with system uptime records by running 
    `python hpc/bin/backfill_systemUptimeHoursToday.py`
3. now see the RAS Metrics view

BTW: If we were doing number-of-uptime based stats (rather than a sliding window of days), 
things would be much easier, eg:
SMTTI of last 5 uptimes
| delta _time AS durationSeconds | eval durationHours=round(durationSeconds/3600,2) | streamstats avg(durationHours) AS SMTTI window=5 global=f | timechart max(MTTI) AS SMTTI
